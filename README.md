# Hire Gosha!

I will write a proper README eventually, but for now this is a little placeholder to acknowledge that proper documentation is important for open source projects.

To get started:

```sh
$ bun install
$ make dev
```

This will install all the required dependencies and start the project locally.

I’ve built this using the following awesome stack:

- [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org)
- [Replicant](https://replicant.fun)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- And of course a little bit of help from [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). Thanks, Claude!

You can see the website running at [hire.gosha.net](https://hire.gosha.net).

Thank you for looking!
