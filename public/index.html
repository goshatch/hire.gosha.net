<strong>A full-stack software engineer with 20+ years of experience</strong>

It's nice to meet you!

I am a true generalist: I am happiest when I can take ownership of problems and contribute across the entire stack, without being siloed to a specific part of it. Backend, frontend, infra, UI, UX, building and mentoring engineering teams — I have done it all over the course of my career.

Currently, I am looking to join a company where I could work on hard problems, share what I know, and grow together with the team over the next many years.

I live in London with my partner and two kids. I can work in both the UK and in the EU, and do not require visa sponsorship.

Please take a look at my past work and skills below, and reach out if you feel I would we would be a good fit.

Current status: <strong>[interviewing]</strong>

-- <strong>Tomomi Sasaki</strong>, Partner at design studio AQ
   <a href="https://aqworks.com" target="_blank">https://aqworks.com</a>


"I've worked with Gosha on many projects over the years. Not only is he an excellent developer and expert in his craft, but he's also a true 'maker', deeply curious and engaged in every aspect of product development. He brings the same level of attention to both the technical implementation and the user experience. As a designer, that quality makes him easily one of my favorite software developers to work with."

"Working with Gosha was like having a strategic co-founder who also writes exceptional code. He quickly grasped the business goals, translated them into clean, scalable architecture, and kept me informed of potential risks long before they became issues. His mix of business acumen and full-stack expertise made our launch smooth and our growth trajectory clear. I recommend him without reservation."

-- <strong>Nahoko Tateyama</strong>, Business Tech Director at SquareTrade
   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nahoko-tateyama/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nahoko-tateyama/</a>


"Gosha brought a strong mix of front-end engineering and design skills when we worked together at Cookpad. He helped build out the mobile web version with solid work in Ruby, JavaScript, and CSS, and his ability to move between design and code made things smoother for the whole team."

-- <strong>Viktor Kelemen</strong>, Software Engineer at Meta
   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktorkelemen/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktorkelemen/</a>

-- <strong>Paul Baron</strong>, Product
   <a href="https://aka.me" target="_blank">https://aka.me</a>


"Over the past five years, I’ve had the luck of working with Gosha both directly—as part of the same cross-functional team—and indirectly as part of the same larger engineering organisation. In every instance, Gosha has been a helpful, collaborative, and fun team player. He brought strong value to both the backend and frontend codebase of our applications. Additionally G’s background and interest in (web)design was radiant in his thoughtful approach to building and suggesting user-centered solutions, always with accessibility in mind. He’s a reliable contributor, pleasure to work with as a colleague, and I highly recommend him as a teammate."
