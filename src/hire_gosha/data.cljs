In every instance, Gosha has been a helpful, collaborative, and fun team player. He brought strong value to both the backend and frontend codebase of our applications.

Additionally G‚Äôs background and interest in (web)design was radiant in his thoughtful approach to building and suggesting user-centered solutions, always with accessibility in mind.
