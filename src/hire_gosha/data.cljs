   :testimonials [{:quote "I've worked with Gosha on many projects over the years. Not only is he an excellent developer and expert in his craft, but he's also a true \"maker\", deeply curious and engaged in every aspect of product development. He brings the same level of attention to both the technical implementation and the user experience. As a designer, that quality makes him easily one of my favorite software developers to work with."
