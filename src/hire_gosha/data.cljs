   [{:quote "I've worked with Gosha on many projects over the years. Not only is he an excellent developer and expert in his craft, but he's also a true \"maker\", deeply curious and engaged in every aspect of product development. He brings the same level of attention to both the technical implementation and the user experience. As a designer, that quality makes him easily one of my favorite software developers to work with."

    {:quote "Working with Gosha was like having a strategic co-founder who also writes exceptional code. He quickly grasped the business goals, translated them into clean, scalable architecture, and kept me informed of potential risks long before they became issues. His mix of business acumen and full-stack expertise made our launch smooth and our growth trajectory clear. I recommend him without reservation."

    {:quote "Over the past five years, I’ve had the luck of working with Gosha both directly—as part of the same cross-functional team—and indirectly as part of the same larger engineering organisation.

In every instance, Gosha has been a helpful, collaborative, and fun team player. He brought strong value to both the backend and frontend codebase of our applications.

Additionally G’s background and interest in (web)design was radiant in his thoughtful approach to building and suggesting user-centered solutions, always with accessibility in mind.

He’s a reliable contributor, pleasure to work with as a colleague, and I highly recommend him as a teammate."
